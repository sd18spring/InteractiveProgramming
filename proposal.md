# Project Proposal  

1. A game in the style of sonic, but simplified to scale to the two weeks. We want to make an interactive game for users where you are running through some world and there are obstacles and 'coins'. We will explore topics of visual animation, the making of an updated display and making the interactive game with keys. The MVP would be to have one static obstacle, one static 'coin', the screen moving. Stretch goals would be to have multiple moving obstacles and coins, changing speeds maybe and moving within the actual screen.

2. Walker would like to get a good understanding of py-game and to understand visual interaction and mixing it with physics models and inputs. Camille would like to gain knowledge on py-game and how to create visuals for the game.

3.  We are planning to use py-game, we don't know other than that yet. We want to use something that we can get help with and since we both do not know anything it seems like a good place to start.

4. We would like to accomplish having a world and a person, we would like to try and get the world moving as well and be thinking about having the obstacle. We will have read and will build an understanding about py-game before this point and will have a better layout of the game and project - have the layout of the classes and some docstrings in there as well. We will be doing a mix of pair programming and independent work for the division of work. Make sure we have all the scafolding done. 

5. Scoping the project, we both don't know what we are getting into so we don't know if this is realistic for us yet, but plan to make adjustments as needed as we go.
