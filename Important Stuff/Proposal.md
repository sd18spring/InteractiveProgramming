Project Proposal
Jonah Spicher & Ashley Swanson

Our project will be a video game, focusing on alternative inputs to the traditional
mouse and keyboard style. Our game will consist of avoiding oncoming obstacles using
pitch to control the height of the little player guy. This nontraditional input will
allow us to explore interactive programming while learning about the tendencies of
foreign libraries such as pygame and OpenCV. As a stretch goal, we would also like
to explore electrical inputs, which would let us do really silly things like a
potentiometer controlled by the strength of your breath blowing on some apparatus.

As For Learning Goals:
Jonah:
  I am excited to learn a little bit about pygame, I would definitely do more with
  that in the future. Making video games sounds cool.
Ashley:
  I am excited to learn about different inputs as I have very little concept of how
  to work with inputs outside of typing something into a box when prompted. I am
  also looking forwards to tackling the documentation involved in figuring out the
  libraries as this is something I generally find intimidating and I would like to
  become more comfortable with it.

And Now For Libraries:
  We are going to use pygame for collisions and other video game features and OpenCV
  to process our audio input. We may need some other ones but thats what we know at
  the moment. Maybe like, math.

By our mid-project check-in:
  We will definitely have installed OpenCV and pygame and made sure specifically
  that OpenCV will work with audio. We will probably also have planned out mostly
  how our code will be structured, and started working on some of that.

Potential Risks:
  We might get so distracted by how hilarious it is that people are screaming at
  our laptop that we never do any work. If you were not aware we are dating so
  its pretty hilarious that we are partners. We are both totally fine with this and 
  work together well (we have worked on projects together before), but if we
  break up over this project we will sue.
