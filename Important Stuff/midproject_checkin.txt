  So, just to explain where we are as of right now, we have implemented a very
basic version of our game, which was how we learned pygame. It makes
obstacles move to the left and you dodge them by moving up and down. It's very
bare bones right now, the plan is to make it nicer and then change the control
scheme to audio, as we discussed in the proposal.

  Speaking of audio, OpenCV will definitely not work. However, we learned that
we can use Pyaudio to record and then Librosa to analyze, and that should do
exactly what we want to do. We will record very small intervals, use Librosa
to find the pitch of the previous interval, and then map the location of the
player sprite to the pitch.
