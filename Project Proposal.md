# Drawing with Fingers
The main idea of our project is to have an interface where someone can use a webcam to trace their finger and use their finger to paint on the screen. We will do a lot of image processing and finger tracking work with OpenCV.

## _Minimal Viable Product_:
* A display that can trace finger movement in black on a white drawing canvas
## _Stretch Goal_: 
* Having a way to turn off the paint so it’s not continuous
* Having two paint brushes/brushes whose hue can be tuned in real time

## Learning Goals for each person:
Tommy: I want to get better at programming with another person, and also with making sure that I use Git properly.
Josh: My goal is to get to use OpenCV more which I have evaded ever since the beginning of last semester.

## Possible Libraries to Use:
The libraries that we will probably be using are OpenCV and Pygame. OpenCV will be how we can utilize the webcams on laptops to keep track of finger movements in the video frame. Pygame will be used to creative an interactive drawing canvas that will put down colors based on the finger movements. The saturation of the colors will stay constant. Different finger speed will then result in different values. We are hoping to incorporate the other hand/fingers in an interesting way so that we can adjust the hue of the brushes.

## Goal before the mid-project check-in
By mid-project check in, we plan on having a skeleton of our code decided, and have a plan for how to implement tracking the finger. We also plan on knowing if pygame and OpenCV have all the resources we need for this project.

## Risks???
The biggest risks might include if we don’t plan out our implementation well and if we have a lot of difficulty with classes.
