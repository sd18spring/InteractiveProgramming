In order to run this game, the first thing you need to install is pygame for Python3.
You can do this by running:

	sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
	sudo easy_install3 pip
	sudo pip3.5 install pygame

The project write-up is called reflection.

The final documents final_game.py. You play by using your mouse to navigate back to the anemone while trying to avoid the trash.
