# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2018 at Olin College.

Packages needed:
pygame (pip install pygame)

To run tron-master.py, enter python3 tron-master.py in the terminal window.

How to play Tron:
WASD keys are used to control the green player while the arrow keys control the orange player.
To win the game, you must be the last one standing.
You die when you hit the walls surrounding the playing grid or if you run into either your or the other player's path indicated by the colored strip left behind.
After a game ends, you can press the space bar to play again.
Enjoy!
