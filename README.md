# Movie Ratings Visualization
In order to run the program, you simply run the script `final.py` by typing the command `python final.py`. The more blue a dot is, the higher the critic to user rating ratio, and the more pink a dot is, the lower this ratio. This ratio was determined with movie-rating data from Rotten Tomato and Metacritic. When a dot is clicked on, the program "zooms in" on the dot and displays dots with the same color gadient, but for each movie-rating website individually.
