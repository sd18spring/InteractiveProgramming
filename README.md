# InteractiveProgramming
This is forked from the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2018 at Olin College.

## Lost Vegas
Our project allows a user to play blackjack interactively with a computer. Using a real deck of cards, a player can deal cards, have them recognized by the computer, and play a hand of blackjack against the computer in real-time. The card detection mechanism works via OpenCV while the Blackjack game uses a class-based implementation in Python

## Requirements
Software requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file and installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This project does have a hardware component though and may be difficult to demo as a result. Steps to demo the project using the hardware:
1. Grab and external usb webcam and plug into your computer (we used a Microsoft Lifecam).
2. Grab a deck of cards
3. A black surface is extremely helpful (but not required) for card matching.
4. When identifying cards, hold the external webcam roughly a cubit directly above the card.
