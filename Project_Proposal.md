#  Project Proposal

We want to create an interactive music board that has note blocks and works similar to a piano keyboard. We will explore mouse controller input, virtual music generation, and possibly computer vision to operate the keyboard. Our minimum viable product would be to have the music board work using a mouse click. Our stretch goal would be to use computer vision to operate the keyboard and play multiple notes at the same time.

Both of us are quite acquainted with programming, so our learning goal is centered around our stretch goal. Neither of us have dealt with computer vision and are up to face the challenge that it provides.

The libraries we are using include PyGame, Sonic Pi, and Open CV.

We plan to have the music board working with at least a mouse click by the mid-project check-in. This will give us another week to try to implement the computer vision.

We believe our largest obstacle with be Open CV as neither of us have any experience with it and are going in blind.
