"""Map.py takes in the information from the other python files and uses Bokeh to display the data in an interactive
way. The key bokeh features involve hovers, a slider, and a map. The script needs to be run using the bokeh server
because callback functions in CustomJS do not support the formation of new ColumnDataSources. (If you know of a way
to output the map as an html without using the bokeh server please email cassandra.overney@students.olin.edu.) For
now, you can run the file by typing "bokeh serve --show Map.py" in the terminal. It will take a few minutes to get
the map to appear. Make sure to have the pandas, bokeh, and pickle libraries installed before running. """
