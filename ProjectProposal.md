### Main Idea
The main idea is to create the game "Asteroids". We will explore classes and the pygame library and generate a playable game at the end. Our MVP is having a controllable rocket ship and asteroids that move around and can be shot. Our strectch goal is adding the UFOs.

### Learning Goals
Corey: To learn how user-game interactions work as well as UI.
Nathan: To learn how the pygame library works, and explore its functions. 

### Libraries
We plan to use mostly pygame for our project, and also random and math. We don't think we will need any other libraries for this project.

### Mid-Project Check-in
We will make an arena and a a player that shoots.

### Biggest Risks
Underestimating the amount of time it will take to complete the game and other tasks.
