# Project Proposal
## Main Idea
The concept of our project is a spin-off of the game Fruit Ninja, except the
players use a physical object to control how the fruits are sliced. We were
planning on exploring vision tracking, and collision detection in the game as
well as learn how to implement basic physics into our game. Our minimum viable
product is a game where players use their mouse to play a simple game of
Fruit Ninja, and our stretch goal is to allow players to use their hands as
the controller.

## Learning Goals:
Amy: Learn how to use the OpenCV library and learn about using python to make games

Sid: Gain experience using a model-view-controller

## Libraries:
We will most likely use pygame and OpenCV for our project.

## Plan:
By Friday:
+ Get started with OpenCV and be able to detect user input
+ Have a general minimum viable concept version of our game with mouse input

Next week:
+ Refine OpenCV object/hand detection
+ Refine game UI
+ Use OpenCV user input in game

## Biggest Risks:
+ Being unable to figure out how to detect objects in OpenCV
+ Being unable to figure out object collision in pygame
