Grace and Quinn
Interactive Programming


	
We want to make a two player game using pygame. Our minimal vibale product is a game of pong, and the stretch goal is airhockey. We will explore two player inputs to generate a simple game output. Quinn's learning goal is to understand the pygame library and how to use github. Grace's goal is to have a deep understanding of our code and project. We are planning on using pygame as our main input library. For our mid prject check in we want to have a clear outline of our code functions and classes as well as how we will distribute the work between us. We would also liked to have started filling in some of this skeleton code. The biggest risk is trying to have two inputs to our game, when we have not yet done anything with a single interactive input.
