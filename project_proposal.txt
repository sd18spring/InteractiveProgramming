Building a program that runs through the Wikipedia summary for a topic the user enters, clicks the first four links, and then the first four links of those first four links, generating connection web. The edge nodes on this web will be clickable, allowing the user to expand the web by the amount that they want.The MVP is a a program with a clickable box, takes input from the user, and presents them with the first order web, sans the clickable edge nodes. A stretch goal is an expandable web of size n that doesnâ€™t intersect itself. with clickable edge nodes and the ability to open the relevant Wikipedia page from the web itself.Aiden wants to learn about how to make and display visual things in Python; UIs that are more than typing into a terminal. Ben wants to learn about object oriented programming and how to optimize performance over large (and displayed data sets). A team reach goal is to have the node tree write to a file and then load it from the file each time.Libraries we plan to use include Wikipedia and PyGame. Will probably end up using Requests as well.We want to have the box built where you can enter input, and some internal logic built out to handle the requests from the rectangle front end. And the dot classes (for the nodes) probably implemented as well.The biggest risk would be having a hard time getting a visualization working that both runs quickly and creating a non-intersecting web.
